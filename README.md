There is a lot of optimization to be done within the javascript. I think it is really hardcoded currently. There is a lot I would change if I felt that I had time to start fresh. 

The storage of questions and answers can likely be done more efficiently. I think I could make a function containing a for loop that would give the answer strings their input type and attributes instead of storing all of that in the answer string.

I couldn't figure out where to put an onclick event for my submitQuiz button which would run my stop and checkAnswers functions. Wherever I included the event it seemed to activate as soon as I clicked the start button, thus showing the results page.

I could likely make the timer a sticky header so it still showed after scrolling down the page.
